# 🚀 Group Making: Connecting Professional Background and Technical Skills

## Getting to know each other

**Before anything else**, please fill in the [skills and topic interests table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IYuw_wmHeIYyrDBzryT0yTa74bt6ztgXCF8zMo6AK0A/edit?usp=sharing)

## Hands on !

In this interactive **group making** activity, participants will present and share their professional backgrounds, as well as tasks they are confident about **programming in Python**, **modeling lifecycle inventories (LCI)**, **MFA (with flodym?)**, the use of **GitHub** and other technical skills. In addition, they will share whether they already have **own data** with which to work or if they have started any **LCA** or **MFA** project.

Each participant should take few minutes to introduce themselves to the others, detailing their work experience, their skill level in the aforementioned areas, and whether they have ongoing projects or own data to work.

## 🎯 Objective
Facilitate participants to better understand each other’s technical skills and level of expertise in key areas such as:
- Python programming 🐍
- Brightway
- Flodym
- MFA
- Project management in **GitHub** 💻
- LCI Modeling 📊
- Data and/or project

## 👋 Examples of How to Introduce yourself to the groups

1. **Name, Role and Professional Background:**  
   "Hi, I'm Karl, **software engineer** with application development experience in **Python**. I have worked on several data analysis and optimization projects, and I have experience in task automation using Python. Currently, I am working on a project on the optimization of industrial processes, using plant data. I only use `ChatGPT` for basic/simple programming tasks."

2. **Technical skills and tasks in which they have confidence:**  
   "I'm Ana, a **researcher** specializing in **life cycle modeling**. I am familiar with tools like **OpenLCA** to create lifecycle inventories and generate reports. In addition, I use **Python** to process and analyze large volumes of environmental data. I’m working on a **LCA** project to assess the impact of consumer products on the life cycle, using data I’ve already collected". 

3. **Python and GitHub Experience:**  
   "My name is Gemma and I'm a **consultant**. I have worked with **Python** in creating algorithms for predictive analytics and developing automated scripts. In addition, I use **GitHub** to manage my projects and collaborate as a team, making sure that the workflow is efficient. Right now, I have an open project in **GitHub** where I share code for the carbon footprint prediction of industrial processes." I rely a lot in using `cursor` to finish my programming tasks.

4. **Projects Related to LCI Modeling and Tool Usage:**  
   "I'm Camille, **PhD student** in sustainability. I specialize in the **modeling LCI** of industrial products for the building sector and have used **Python** for data simulation and predictive model generation. I’m also active on **GitHub** to collaborate on open source projects. Currently, I am working with data provided by a company to assess the life cycle of its products". I'm usually always programming with `cursor` or `ChatGPT` open, or just in case I hit a road block.

- **Guide to Presentation:** Some key questions that can be used:
  - "What projects have you recently worked on that involve **programming in Python** or **modeled LCI** or **MFA**?"
  - "What tools or libraries of **Python** do you master with confidence?"
  - "Do you have experience using **GitHub** to manage projects or collaborate with others?"
  - "What tasks related to sustainability and life cycle analysis do you feel most comfortable with?"
  - "Do you have your own data you're working with or a **LCA** or **MFA** project you've already started?"
  - "How much do you rely on AI to accomplish your programming tasks?"

- **Goal:** Make sure each participant shares specific details about their technical skills, especially in key areas such as:
  - **Programming in Python** (bookstores, frameworks) 🐍
  - **Modeling of Life Cycle Inventories (LCI)** 📊
  - **MFA**
  - **AI** for programming
  - **GitHub** use for version control, collaboration, and project management 💻
  - **LCA projects** in progress or data available 📑
